# Endless Sky - Central HUD

Rearranges the in-flight HUD of your ship during flight. Originally made for another plugin I am making (A New Dawn), however it seemed like people liked the look of this.

To install just drag the files into the "plugins" folder in your Endless Sky install.
I have included an optional colour scheme which will be used in my main plugin in "color scheme.txt", feel free to delete this if you would prefer the vanilla colours.
Improvements and bug reports welcome!

Known issues:
- Very long messages can go behind the ship and status bars (I moved the escorts up, and pushed the messages to the side, so there is a little bit of wiggle room, but I have not been able to anchor the messages to the top - suggestions welcome!)
