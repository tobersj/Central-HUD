# Endless Sky - Central HUD

Slightly rearanges the HUD of your ship during flight.
Orginally made for another plugin I am making, however it seemed like people liked the look of it anyway.

To install just drag the files into the "plugins" folder in your Endless Sky install.
I have included an optional color scheme which will be used in my main plugin. This starts out comentented (with #), so just remove the "#" to use it.


Improvements and bug reports welcome!

Known issues:
- Very long messages can go behind the ship and status bars.
